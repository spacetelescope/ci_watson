*********
ci_watson
*********

``ci_watson`` is a test helper for Continuous Integration (CI) testing
at STScI using GitHub Actions and Artifactory.

This package has two components:

* ``pytest`` plugin containing markers and fixtures.
* Generic CI helpers for STScI tests using GitHub Actions and Artifactory.


Plugin
======

The plugin portion of ``ci_watson`` contains:

* ``--slow`` option and ``@pytest.mark.slow`` decorator to run or skip
  tests that are resource intensive. What counts as resource intensive
  is up to the author of the test.
* ``--bigdata`` option and ``@pytest.mark.bigdata`` decorator to run or skip
  tests that require intranet (Artifactory, Central Storage, etc) access.
  Additional setup is required for these tests to run successfully
  (see :ref:`bigdata_setup`).
  It is up to the author of the test to perform such setup properly.
* ``--env`` option and ``envopt`` fixture to set the test environment to
  ``"dev"`` or ``"stable"``. This plugin only sets the value. It is up to
  the author of the test to use this environment setting properly.
* ``_jail`` fixture to enable a test to run in a pristine temporary working
  directory. This is particularly useful for pipeline tests.
* ``resource_tracker`` and ``log_tracked_resources`` fixtures to track
  memory and runtime and log them in the junit xml results file.

Configuration Options
---------------------

``inputs_root``/``results_root`` - The 'bigdata' remote repository name/local
data root directory for testing input/output files. Setting the value of
either option will make it availble to tests via the ``pytestconfig`` fixture.
Test code can then obtain the name of the artifactory repository/local data
root directory to use when accessing locations needed for running tests.

Note: If used, these values should appear in either ``pytest.ini`` OR the appropriate
section in ``setup.cfg``, *not both*.

Example configuration within ``setup.cfg``::

  [tool:pytest]
  inputs_root = my_data_repo
  results_root = my_results_repo

Example configuration within ``pytest.ini``::

  [pytest]
  inputs_root = my_data_repo
  results_root = my_results_repo

The value(s) defined in the pytest configuration file may be accessed as a list
by test code via the ``pytestconfig`` fixture which must be passed in as an
argument to the test method or function that will use the value.

Example of accessing configuration values within test code itself::

  def test_important_thing(pytestconfig):
      setup_cfg_inputs_root = pytestconfig.getini('inputs_root')[0]
      assert setup_cfg_inputs_root == 'my_data_repo'

From within a fixture or a test class the configuration values must be accessed using a slightly different approach::

    import pytest
    inputs_root = pytest.config.getini('inputs_root')[0]

Setting Up For Big Data
=======================

The ``--bigdata`` option is used together with the environment variable,
``TEST_BIGDATA``, as used by
:func:`~ci_watson.artifactory_helpers.get_bigdata_root`. For local testing,
set this variable to where you downloaded your Artifactory data.
For remote testing (e.g., with GitHub Actions), set it to your Artifactory path
in the GitHub Actions workflow file, as appropriate. For more details,
please refer to STScI Innerspace document for
"Users Guide: Running Regression Tests".
